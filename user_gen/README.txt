This script (genuser.sh) generates automatically users that have the usernames listed in the user.txt files. It will generate a log file that contains the user name and the password for each user.

It needs the program passwdgen that can be downloaded (and needs to be built) from here:
http://code.google.com/p/passwdgen/downloads/


The program gen_username.py generates the uernames file that is used as input
for the genuser.sh script.
